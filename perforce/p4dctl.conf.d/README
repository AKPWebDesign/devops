Files in this directory with names matching *.conf will automatically
be included by p4dctl. 

Each file should conform to the same syntax as /etc/perforce/p4dctl.conf itself.

For example, a specification to start a Perforce server might look
like this:

p4d main
{
    Owner	= 	perforce
    Execute	=	/usr/bin/p4d
    P4ROOT	=	/p4/p4-main
    P4JOURNAL	=	journal
    P4PORT	=	1666
    PATH	=	/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/perforce/sbin:/opt/perforce/bin
}
